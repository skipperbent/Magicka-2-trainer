# Known issues
The game seems to use different memory slots every time it launches. It might not be working at first, so keep trying until you find the slots that has been hacked. For the best chance of success, I recommend that you start the trainer AFTER when the game has been loaded and your character is on-screen, as the game might check if the memory slots are in use or is being read.

## Linux / MacOS
Should work fine on Linux/MacOS if you install the Mono SDK, not tested though...
